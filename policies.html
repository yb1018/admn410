<h2> <u>Financing Policies</u> </h2>
<h3> Payment Types </h3>
<section1>The company offers several ways of payments: the customer can pay the full due amount at the time of the purchase (or rent) of the book; 
30 days allowance is available, with a 10% increase in the amount due. At the end of the 30 days, the due payment will double the initial amount. 
After 60 days, the open account will be sent to an external collector and reported to the Credit Bureau. </section1>
<h4> Credit Card Payments </h4>
<section1>Forever Classics accepts credit card payments. Visa and Mastercard are accepted. Paypal is accepted too. No cryptocurrencies are accepted.</section1> 
<h5> Purchase Of Books </h5> 
<section1>The purchase of books has to be made by appointment, in order for the company to order a copy of it. The purchase of the book is anticipated by a 
nonrefundable deposit of $25. The purchasing of books can be made from our website, as well as in person. The cost of the purchase of books will be
10% higher than the the cost of books purchase in-store. Included in the payment there will be the shipping cost of the products, plus other taxes and fees. </section1>
<h6> Rent Of Books </h6>
<section1>The rent of books does not need any appointment. Prior to the rent of any product, the company requires a non-expired ID, and 
Social Security Number of the renter, and a valid credit card information. The cost of the rent is based on the amount of time that products are rented: for every month of rent, 
the cost is going to increase by 5%, starting from a monthly rent cost of $30. The maximum amount of time for the rent of a book is 12 months. 
Failure to return the products before the end of the 12th month will result in a $50 fee each month debited to the credit card on file. </section1>
<h6> Damage fees </h6>
<section1> Forever Classics is going to debit damage fees to the credit cards on file if any damage to the rented products is detected. If the customer
notices any problem with the product, they should call the customer assistance at the number +144(344)657-0912, or visit any local shop for informations. </section1>
<h6> Loyal Customer Program </h6>
<section1> Forever Classics is offering rewards and discounts to the customers with at least 10 purchased or rented products. Rewards and discounts will consist of
monthly discount percentages on the products, or promotions like 2 per 1. To be part of the Loyal Customer program, customers will have to register at the time of their
tenth payment. The customers will have to give their name, email, phone number, and Social Security Number to  the cashier. </section1>
<h2> <u>Delivery Policy</u> </h2>
<section1> In case of a rented or purchased product from the website, the customer will have to pay taxes, fees, and shipment costs too. Forever Classics is responsible
of the product until the shipment; after the shipment, the responsibility will be of the customer. Payments are nonrefundable as soon as the products have been shipped, 
unless the products show any damage not caused by the customer. 
</section1>
<h2> <u>Return Policy</u> </h2>
<section1> Forever Classics offers a 30 days return policy on purchased products. The customer will have to show up to any local shop and show the receipt of the payment. 
After the return of the product(s), the customer will have to spend the same amount or more for other products. Cash will not be given back in return for the products.
